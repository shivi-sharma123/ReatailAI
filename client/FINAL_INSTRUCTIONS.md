## 🔧 To Fix the "Connection Error"

cd server
python app.py
```
You should see:
```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
* Debug mode: on
```

### Step 2: Start the React Frontend  
```bash
# In terminal 2 (frontend)
npm start
```
You should see:
```
Local:            http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Test the Chatbot
Go to http://localhost:3000 and try these inputs:

**Weather-based:**
- "It's raining outside" → Rain gear
- "Beautiful sunny day" → Sunglasses, summer clothes
- "Cold winter day" → Warm clothes

**Mood-based:**
- "I'm feeling sad" → Comfort items
- "Happy and excited" → Bright, cheerful products
- "Need some comfort" → Cozy clothes

**Activity-based:**
- "Going to a party tonight" → Party dresses, accessories
- "Need workout clothes" → Fitness gear
- "Business meeting tomorrow" → Professional attire
- "Casual day at home" → Casual wear
- "Date night plans" → Romantic outfits

## 🛠️ Admin Panel Features

Go to http://localhost:3000/admin to:
- ✅ View all products with images
- ✅ Add new products with AR capabilities
- ✅ Edit existing products
- ✅ Delete products
- ✅ View analytics dashboard

## 🎯 Expected Chatbot Responses

When working correctly, the chatbot will:

1. **Analyze your input** for mood/weather/activity
2. **Detect the appropriate category** (rainy, sunny, party, etc.)
3. **Return matching products** from the database
4. **Show AR-enabled products** with "Try in AR" buttons
5. **Display product details** including prices, ratings, stock

## 📊 Sample Product Data

The database includes products for these categories:
- **rainy**: Waterproof jackets, rain boots
- **sunny**: Sunglasses, summer clothes  
- **party**: Party dresses, elegant accessories
- **comfort**: Hoodies, blankets, cozy items
- **energetic**: Running shoes, workout gear
- **casual**: Jeans, t-shirts, everyday wear
- **professional**: Business suits, formal wear
- **romantic**: Evening gowns, jewelry
- **happy**: Bright, cheerful clothing
- **general**: Bestsellers, popular items

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to my brain!"
**Cause**: Flask backend not running on port 5000
**Fix**: Start the Flask server with `python app.py`

### Chatbot returns fallback text products instead of database products
**Cause**: Database not properly initialized or empty
**Fix**: Run the database initialization script

### Products have no images
**Cause**: Image URLs not properly configured
**Fix**: Check product data has valid `image_url` fields

### AR viewer not working
**Cause**: AR models require HTTPS in production
**Fix**: Use localhost for development, HTTPS for production

## 🌟 Next Steps for Production

1. **Deploy to cloud** (AWS, Heroku, etc.)
2. **Use HTTPS** for AR features
3. **Add real product images** and AR models
4. **Integrate with inventory system**
5. **Add user authentication**
6. **Implement real payment processing**
