- **Text Colors**: Updated from white to dark colors for better visibility

### 2. **VirtualARTryOn.js**
- **Before**: Same dark black overlay
- **After**: Same colorful gradient background
- **Consistent**: Matches the new colorful theme

### 3. **NoCamera3DAR.js**

- **Enhanced**: Better product visibility

```
