# AR Issues Fixed - Complete Resolution

## âœ… **Both Issues Successfully Resolved!**

### **Issue 1: JSX Parsing Error**
**Problem:** `Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag` error on line 372
**Root Cause:** The EnhancedARViewer.js file had corrupted or orphaned JSX elements outside the function scope
**Solution:** 
- Completely recreated the EnhancedARViewer.js file from scratch
- Ensured proper JSX fragment wrapping with `<>` and `</>`
- Cleaned up any orphaned code outside the component function
- Added proper inline styling with full positioning for modal display

### **Issue 2: Product Images Not Showing Full Size**
**Problem:** Products were only showing as virtual representations/drawings instead of actual product images
**Root Cause:** Both AR components (VirtualARTryOn and NoCamera3DAR) were using canvas drawings instead of real product images
**Solution:**
- Added actual product image display to both AR components
