- **Automatically displays** below product reviews and details

#### **What it shows:**
- **Frequently Bought Together** - Bundle of related products with checkboxes
- **Related Products Grid** - Smart recommendations based on product category

ProductRecommendationsComponent={() => (
  <ProductRecommendations
    currentProduct={selectedProduct}
    allProducts={productDatabase}
    onProductClick={handleProductClick}
    onAddToCart={handleAddToCart}
  />
)}
```

#### **Smart Logic:**
- **Same Category First** - Finds products in same category as current product

#### **How it works:**

<AdvancedFilters 
  products={productDatabase}
  onFilterChange={onFilterChange}
/>

// Real-time filtering in useEffect
if (appliedFilters.brands && appliedFilters.brands.length > 0) {
  filtered = filtered.filter(product => 
    appliedFilters.brands.includes(product.brand)
  );
}
```
